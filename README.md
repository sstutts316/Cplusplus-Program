# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I created a grocery tracking program using C++ and python.  I had to read an input file that contained a list of items that are sold throughout the day.  I needed to create a menu using C++ and a list of functions in python that would be used to track the grocery items and how much of that item is sold throughout the day.

# What did you do particularly well?
I think I defined the functions in python well.  I was able to create a list and frequency of items, have the user pick an item which would let the user know how much of that item was sold, and read and write files.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I would enhance my code in C++.  By enhancing my code I could modify my code with functions so I don't have to repeat code, I could have even added classes with private members to make my code more secure.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found that trying to call the functions from python to C++ challenging because special methods had to be used or I would not produce the output I need.  I asked for help because I was having trouble trying to get my desired output.  Input validation in C++ was also I huge challenge for me because I didn't know how to code it properly between the two languages.  I, unfortunately, did not overcome this obstacle. My instructor was my main resource because when I had a challenge, he provided feedback to help me figure out where I was going wrong.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I believe that knowing how to link and code multiple languages will be very beneficial because other projects from other courses may require knowledge of this concept.  Also, there are many companies that I may apply to one day may require the use of multiple languages to complete their projects. So, I feel that mastering the concept of mutiple languages in a single project is transferable to anywhere I go in my computer science future.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I practiced best standards when writing my code.  I made sure I added neccessary whitespace and newlines so that code wouldn't be bunched together.  I added inline comments to let another programmer know what I was do to a particular line or block of code.
